# ELDERLY GAMES PRESENTS: BAR CRAWLER

# DESCRIPTION:
Bar Crawler is a 2D Local Multiplayer Fighter set in a bar where two bar mates are pitted against each other in a drunken duel. Bar Crawler is a controller game so make sure you have a gamepad and a buddy to play against. There are three game modes to choose from: Classic, Dodgeball, and Slip n' Slide. In all game modes, the players have the ability to punch other players as a stun, pick up bottles, and throw the bottles at each to deal damage; the caveat is that the player must drink before throwing the empty bottle, thus feeling the wrath of their indulgence. Classic is a best of 3 rounds where bottles spawn around the map on tables. Dodgeball is also a best of 3 rounds but instead of being able to move anywhere in the bar, players are not divided by a line of tables where the bottles spawn. Slip n' Slide is a map full of wet floor spots where players must navigate the wet debris and face the other player in another 3 round bout.
